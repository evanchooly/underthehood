* Basic Class structure
  * [BasicClass.java](src/main/java/com/antwerkz/underthehood/BasicClass.java)
  * look at [javap](target/txt-files/BasicClass.javap) 
    * javap provides loads of details that are often overkill if you're debugging, say, generated bytecode
    * but it's useful
    * much more useful, usually, is the asm output:
  * look at [asm](target/txt-files/BasicClass.txt)
    * this file is generated but we'll use the plugin for this output going forward
      * it gets generated as part of the build so if you want to play around, simple run `mvn compile` or use the plugin as well.
    * note the ctor with `<init>()`
    * note the super call with `invokespecial`
    * note the "internal name" form of the fqcn for Object
    * ignore most of the rest. we'll get there.
* Let's add some fields
  *  [Fields.java](src/main/java/com/antwerkz/underthehood/Fields.java)
  * look at [javap](target/txt-files/Fields.javap)
  * look at [asm](target/txt-files/Fields.txt) 
  * Note the field init'ing in the generated ctor
  * `putfield` is the bc for setting a field's value
  * in the javap output, the target is referenced via the constant pool
    * to follow it, you have to deref multiple values
    * the asm output helpfully just puts it all in one place
      * javap closer to binary bytecode.
      * asm output easier to debug
  * add another constructor
    * default ctor gone
    * args show type in `I` and String in descriptor format
    * note the `bipush`
      * 42 fits in a byte so it uses the smallest operation
      * bump value up, `sipush`, more, `ldc`
* Let's add some methods
  * [Methods.java](src/main/java/com/antwerkz/underthehood/Methods.java)
  * look at [javap](target/txt-files/Methods.javap)
  * look at [asm](target/txt-files/Methods.txt) 
  * Let's add a new method with some local variables
  * `int local`
  * see the new variable in `LOCALVARIABLETABLE`
    * slot 1
    * the labels
    * just denote the return
      * variable is unused
  * then do math
    * now L1 to L3
      * used/visible in that scope
  * `var name`
    * just the return scope
  * reassign name
    * new labels
* Flow Control
  * [FlowControl.java](src/main/java/com/antwerkz/underthehood/FlowControl.java)
  * look at [javap](target/txt-files/FlowControl.javap)
  * look at [asm](target/txt-files/FlowControl.txt)
  * frames are used to speed up the verifier so that local variable inferences/slots can be verified in a single pass
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25109942/what-is-a-stack-map-frame
  * note the cmp bytecode
    * the cmp bytecode is the "inverse" of what you'd expect because of the stack order
* Generics
  * [Generics.java](src/main/java/com/antwerkz/underthehood/Generics.java)
  * look at [javap](target/txt-files/Generics.javap)
  * look at [asm](target/txt-files/Generics.txt) 
  * Note the signature and declaration
    * plugin and bottom of javap
* Generic method calls
  * [GenericMethods.java](src/main/java/com/antwerkz/underthehood/GenericMethods.java)
  * look at [javap](target/txt-files/GenericMethods.javap)
  * look at [asm](target/txt-files/GenericMethods.txt)
    * "dup" to use the newly created reference in invokespecial 
    * Bridge/synthetic methods
* Autoboxing
  * [AutoBoxing.java](src/main/java/com/antwerkz/underthehood/AutoBoxing.java)
  * look at [javap](target/txt-files/AutoBoxing.javap)
  * look at [asm](target/txt-files/AutoBoxing.txt)
  * 'a' and 'b' have slots 1 and 3
    * 64 bit
  * work through various invocations
* Inner/static classes
  * [TopLevel.java](src/main/java/com/antwerkz/underthehood/Lambdas.java)
  * look at [javap](target/txt-files/TopLevel.javap)
  * look at [asm](target/txt-files/TopLevel.txt)
  * see nest members
    * allows for access to private members without bridge methods
* Lambdas
  * [Lambdas.java](src/main/java/com/antwerkz/underthehood/Lambdas.java)
  * look at [javap](target/txt-files/Lambdas.javap)
  * look at [asm](target/txt-files/Lambdas.txt)
  * BootstrapMethods and constant pool
    * javap is sometimes easier to read
    * plugin has related code bracketed
  * Effectively final
* Records
  * [Records.java](src/main/java/com/antwerkz/underthehood/Records.java)
  * look at [javap](target/txt-files/Records.javap)
  * look at [asm](target/txt-files/Records.txt)
  * extends Record
  * fields are final
  * free methods
